1) n piles of coins.
2) two players change and take arbitrary num > 0 from any pile. 
3) who win (take the last coin)?

***************

example:

6, 9, 3 

bin:

 110
1001
  11
---- xor

1100

first loses only if ( 6 ^ 9 ^ 3 == 0 )

move strategy -> make xor == 0 for the opponent.

always possible 

1) find number where leftmost 1 of xorsum is 1. 
2) change it to the zero.
3) For every other 1 in xorsum, flip the bit in that number.
